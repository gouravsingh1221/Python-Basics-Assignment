It looks a lot like regular English, so writing and understanding code in Python feels simple and natural. One of the main reasons Python is so popular is because it can be used for many different things, such as building websites, making apps, analyzing data, creating games, or even working with artificial intelligence. It also has a huge community of users, which means there are lots of tutorials, support, and free tools available online. On top of that, Python comes with powerful libraries—these are like pre-made tools that help you do complex tasks more easily. All of these things make Python a flexible, beginner-friendly, and widely used language in the tech world.\n","\n","Q.2   What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","  - The Python interpreter acts like a translator between you and the computer, helping your instructions  turn into actions the computer can understand and perform.\n","\n","Q.3  What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that are already set by the Python language. You can’t use them as variable names, function names, or anything else because they have a special meaning in Python. For e.g. if,else,elif.\n","\n","Q.4  Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","  - No, kywords can not be used as variable because every keyword has specail meaning so it cant be taken as variable.\n","\n","Q.5  What is mutability in Python?\n","  - Mutability in Python means where a value  can be changed after it is created like a variable, list or object. You can add, remove, or change items.\n","\n","Q.6  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","  - Lists are mutable becaue lists are designed for situations where you might want to add, remove, or change items and tuples are imutable because Because tuples are used when you want fixed, unchangeable data. It helps make your program safer and faster, especially when the data should stay the same like a certificate—once it’s printed, you can’t change it.\n","\n","Q.7  What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n"," - The == operator checks if two values are the same. It looks at what is inside the variables. For example, if two lists have the same items, == will return True. On the other hand, the is operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory. Even if two lists have the same values, they are different objects, so is will return False. But if one variable is just another name for the same object, then is will return True. So, == checks for same value, and is checks for same identity .\n","\n","Q.8  What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n"," - Logical operators in Python are used to make decisions based on conditions. They help combine two or more conditions and return True or False.\n","\n","Q.9  What is type casting in Python?\n"," - In Python, type casting means changing one data type to another.\n","\n","\n","Q.10  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n"," - Implicit type casting happens automatically when Python changes the type for you. On the other hand, explicit type casting is when you do it yourself by using functions like int(), float(), or str(). This is done when you want to be sure about the type change. So, the main difference is that implicit casting is done by Python, while explicit casting is done by the programmer.\n","\n","Q.11  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","- The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to help the program make decisions. They allow the program to choose what to do based on certain conditions.\n","\n","Q.12  How does the elif statement work?\n","- The elif statement in Python means \"else if\", and it is used to check another condition if the first if condition is not true. It helps you check many different options one by one. Python will check the if condition first. If that is false, it checks the elif. If the elif is true, it runs that part of the code. You can also add an else at the end if none of the conditions are true.\n","\n","Q.13 8 What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","- he for loop and while loop are both used to repeat code in Python, but they work in different ways. A while loop is used when you don’t know exactly how many times you need to repeat, but you want to keep going as long as a condition is true.A for loop is used when you know how many times you want to repeat something. It goes through a list, range, or any sequence.\n","\n","Q.14 8 Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","- A while loop is more suitable when you don’t know how many times the loop should run and you want to keep going until a certain condition is met. For example, if you are asking a user to enter a password until they get it right, you don’t know how many tries they will need. In this case, a while loop is better because it will keep asking the user again and again until the correct password is entered. So, a while loop is useful when the number of repetitions is not fixed.\n","correct_password = \"python123\"\n","user_input = \"\"\n","\n","while user_input != correct_password:\n","    user_input = input(\"Enter the password: \")\n","\n","print(\"Access granted!\")\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"FK7wnsv0vKzw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **PRACTICAL QUESTIONS**"],"metadata":{"id":"5wqAc264_ay5"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"id":"Ovzx9NpnuPJI","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749481634607,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":69993,"user":{"displayName":"Gourav singh baloria","userId":"01974411811332738462"}},"outputId":"4a38b733-5069-4cbc-ee3b-2af417739c66"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n","My name is Gourav singh baloria\n","I am 20 years old\n","Python keywords are:\n","['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']\n","Enter a word: 10\n","'10' is NOT a Python keyword.\n","Original list: [1, 2, 3]\n","Modified list: [10, 2, 3]\n","\n","Original tuple: (1, 2, 3)\n","You cannot change a tuple.
